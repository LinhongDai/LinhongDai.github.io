**Abstract.**<br/>

In Indonesia, it's hard for the medium and small wholesalers to digitalize the stock and keep track of it. They get used to do it manually.

In this work, we aim to help them effectively keep track of the seasonal popular food categories. With that information, those wholesalers can get more inventories of that type of food.

To achieve this, we built and trained a Bert Model to predict a food product's category, and we integrated the model with an API that can be consumed by downstream applications.

We used more than 23000 entries to enrich our model, elevating first-level product categorization accuracy from 75% to 94%, and
second-level product categorization accuracy from 75% to 91%.
